## List of Projects
*Python*
+ [**Predicting Earthquake Damage Grade**](https://github.com/k-ersan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20Earthquake%20Damage%20Grade)

**Background Information and Objective**\
Utilizing Machine Learning methods to create models in order to predict the damage grade of Kaggle dataset - 1,2 or 3 and comparing which algorithm is most suitable and efficient in this case, considering different accuracy parameters (accuracy score, micro/macro/weighted f1 and average score) and also the trade-offs between features and computational times of the different algorithms.\
**Machine Learning Methods** : K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent.

**Tools and Skills**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis.

### Micro Projects
*Python*
+ [**Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office**](https://github.com/k-ersan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies) 

**Background Information and Objective**\
When pressing "watch next episode" on Netflix, you start to feel that movies are getting shorter than they were years ago and notice that some guest stars appears more in the most popular episodes of "The Office". By utilizing different tools visualization and data exploratory tools, we can approach the answer to this better.

**Tools and Skills**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Exploratory Data Analysis

*SQL*
+ [**Analyzing International Debt Statistics**](https://github.com/k-ersan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Analyzing%20International%20Debt) 

**Background Information and Objective**\
It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries. In this project, we are analyzing international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Questions to answer include:
+ What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
+ Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
+ What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

**Tools and Skills**: Data Manipulation, Iporting and Cleaning Data
